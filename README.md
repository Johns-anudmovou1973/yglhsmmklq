Dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Death of a Unicorn and... what the heck did I just see? Like, seriously, I'm not even sure what was going on half the time. You know when a  's plot just goes all over the place and you're like, Um, okay...? Yeah, that was me the entire time. I mean, the freaking unicorn! It was there, then poof, it wasn't, and I'm like, did I even 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   right? Should I have just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the   in the theater or something? 

Honestly, some parts were kinda epic though. The visuals? On point, but like, why was the dialogue trying so hard to be deep? It's a unicorn, dude, gimme some fun, not an existential crisis. And the main character, oh my God. Sometimes she was all kick-ass, and other times she was just... there, ya know? Like, hello? Earth to protagonist!

> So get this, there's this scene where I legit thought, Is this supposed to be a metaphor or did the writers just get bored? And then bam, unicorn appears for like 2 minutes and it's like... whaaat? Can't get over how the climax was just wrap-up central with nothing making sense. Like, they had this whole build-up and then... nothing! Gotta say, it left me feeling kinda 𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘵ed, dude.

Also, can't forget that one hilarious moment when the sidekick character just starts — what's the word — soliloquizing? Yeah, thought I was in a Shakespearean play or something. I literally burst out laughing in my living room, 'cause who does that in 2023 about a freaking unicorn?

int main() { return 0; }

Anyway, would I recommend it? If you're ready to be confused but mildly entertained, then why not? Grab some popcorn, kick back, and brace yourself for the wild ride. Just one of those 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 that's all over the place, but somehow you can't stop 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨. Give it a go if you wanna tackle a migraine head-on.
